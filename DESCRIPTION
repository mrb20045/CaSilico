Description: we developed a tool matching the needs of both beginners and experts, named Casilico,
    which was inspired by the limitations of the current gRNA design tools for designing crRNAs for Cas12,
    Cas13, and Cas14 CRISPR-Cas systems. Casilico outperforms previous crRNA design tools in the following respects:
    1) supporting any reference genome/transcriptome for which a FASTA file is available;
    2) designing crRNAs that simultaneously target multiple sequences through conserved region detection among a set of sequences;
    3) considering new CRISPR-Cas subtypes; 
    4) reporting a list of different features for each candidate crRNA, which can help the user to select the best one.
